## General Information
- If you want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote
- Gesture like:
  -	Thumbs Up: Increase the volume. 
  -	Thumbs Down: Decrease the volume.  
  -	Left Swipe: Jump backward 10 Sec. 
  -	Right Swipe: Jump forward 10 Sec. 
  -	Stop: Pause the movie. 
- dataset being used in this project: we've used open source data set that are available in kaggle (Human Gesture Recognition)
